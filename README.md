# Objective
Analyze projected changes in drought in Norway based on distributed HBV runoff simulation. 

# Available data

##  Henrik's analysis for the historical period based on seNorge data  
- in `/hdata/fou/drought` stores developed R scripts
- [ ] Understand what, why and how.

## Analysis for the future period based on CMIP5 climate model projections
 
- Why CMIP5? Because CMIP6 not publicly available yet
- Main question: "The whole idea is to use his scripts to run analyses on hydrological projections (runoff) to see if the runoff droughts are expected to last longer in the future." "our plan is to use the distHBV runoff results and look at the runoff drought characteristics (duration and/or deficit volume)"
